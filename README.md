# Chiplet-on-Wheels

On the advent of the slow death of Moore's law, the silicon industry is moving towards a new era of chiplets.The automotive industry is experiencing a profound transformation towards software-defined vehicles, fueled by the surging demand for automotive compute chips, expected to reach $20-22$ billion by 2030. 
Breaking down System-on-Chips (SoCs) into functional units, offers unparalleled customization and integration possibilities. Our investigation will compare these advancements to traditional monolithic System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we will delve deeper into various interconnect protocols, examining their latency and communication efficiency. This examination will be supported by simulations as well as insights derived from a synthesis of research papers and technical articles.We present a thermal design methodology, using simulation tools that optimize the complex dependencies involved in packaging a chip.
